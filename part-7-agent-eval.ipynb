    "# Part 7: Evaluating AI Agents\n",
    "In [Part-6-Observability](https://github.com/asanyaga/ai-agents-tutorial/blob/main/part-6-agent-observability.ipynb) we built logging, tracing, metrics, and token tracking into our code review agent.  \n",
    "We can now see *what* our agent does. But, observability alone does not tell you whether the agent is doing things correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial addresses the question; *How do we systematically measure whether an agent works*\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will be building very simple evaluations for the code review agent. We are building from scratch and keeping it simple to demostrate key concepts rather than full implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## From Observability to Evaluation\n",
    "Observability and evaluation are complementary\n",
    "- **Observability** answers: \"What happened during this execution?\"\n",
    "- **Evaluation** answers: \"Was that execution correct?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Observability gives you the data. Evaluation gives you the judgement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional software testing is straightforward; given input X, expect output Y. The vast majority of traditional software is deterministic, meaning that given the same input and in the same conditions we can expect the output is always going to be the same.\n",
    "AI Agents rely on outputs from large language models which are non deterministic which means the output from an AI agent is also not deterministic;\n",
    "- The same query might produce different tool sequences\n",
    "- Valid outputs can vary in phrasing while meaning the same thing\n",
    "- Correct output and behaviour from agents often requires judgement not just exact output matching\n",
    "- The path that the agent takes to get to the result matthers, not just the final output"
