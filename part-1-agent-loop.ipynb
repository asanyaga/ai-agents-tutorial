    "## Introduction\n",
    "If you have worked with tools like ChaptGTP or LangChain you've probably heard the term **AI Agent** thrown around a lot. But what is an agent really? \n",
    "\n",
    "In this first part of the series, we will break down the **AI agent loop** - the core idea behind how intelligent systems *observe, think and act.* \n",
    "\n",
    "By the end you will:\n",
    "* Understand the observation-thought-action cycle\n",
    "* Implement a **basic agent loop in Python**\n",
    "* See how this looop can evolve into a more advanced agent goals, tools goals and memory\n",
    "\n",
    "And best of all - everything here runs right inside a Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "### Before you begin\n",
    "* Make sure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/) installed\n",
    "* Install and setup [OpenAI Python library]([https://platform.openai.com/docs/libraries)\n",
    "* Install and setup [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install)\n",

    "## What is an AI Agent\n",
    "An agent is a system that:\n",
    "1. **Observes** its environment\n",
    "2. **Thinks** based on goals and context\n",
    "3. **Acts** in that environment\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words:\n",
    "> **Agent = Observe -> Think -> Act**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple way to picture it:\n",

    "### The Code Reviewer Intern\n",
    "Imagine you have hired an intern to help review code\n",
    "* You show them a piece of code and an instruction(*observation*)\n",
    "* They think about it and and form their opinion of the code (*thought*)\n",
    "* They reply with a comment (*action*)\n",
