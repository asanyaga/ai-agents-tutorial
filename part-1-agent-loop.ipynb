    "# From Prompts to Agents: Understanding the AI Agent Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "If you have worked with tools like ChaptGTP or LangChain you've probably heard the term **AI Agent**, often mentioned, but not always clearly explained.  \n",
    "In this tutorial series, we will demystify what AI agents really are. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this first part of the series, we will start with the core concept, the **AI agent loop** - the core idea behind how intelligent systems *observe, think and act.*  \n",
    "We will also take a look at the basic building blocks of AI agents which we will build step by step throughout the series.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end you will:\n",
    "* Understand the observation-thought-action cycle\n",
    "* Implement a basic **agent loop** in Python\n",
    "* See how this loop can evolve into a more advanced agent with goals, tools and memory\n",
    "\n",
    "### To run the Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "* Make sure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/) installed\n",
    "* Install and setup [OpenAI Python library]([https://platform.openai.com/docs/libraries). In this tutorial we will be using Openai LLM models but you can use any LLM model or provider that you are familiar with since the concepts are not provider specific.\n",
    "* Install and setup [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install)\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is an AI Agent\n",
    "An agent is a system that:\n",
    "1. **Observes** its environment\n",
    "2. **Thinks** based on goals and context\n",
    "3. **Acts** in that environment\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words:\n",
    "> **Agent = Observe -> Think -> Act**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple way to picture it:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Agent Loop](agent-loop.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Agent Building Blocks\n",
    "Now that we have seen the **Agent Loop** - *Observe -> Think -> Act* let's take a look at the core building blocks that make this work in practice.\n",
    "We'll explore each of these in more details later in the series, but here is a simple overview to get started:\n",
    "1. **Prompt:** - This is how we communicate the goal and situation to the agent. It includes goals, instruction and context to help the agent reason effectively.\n",
    "2. **LLM:** The *brain* of the agent. It processes the prompt and context, reasons through the situation, and decides what to do next by producing natural language outputs or strucutred actions.\n",
    "3. **Tools:** Tools allow the agent to go beyond text; to fetch data, run code, search the web, send emails, or intereact with APIs. Tools use connects LLM reasoning and real world action.\n",
    "4. **Memory:** Memory lets the agent recall instructions, past experiences, conversations or actions so that it can act more consistently and intelligently over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "These four building blocks work together inside the agent loop. The prompt tells the LLM what to do, the LLM decides an action, tools let it perform that action, and memory helps it learn and adapt from experience.\n",

    "### The Code Reviewer Assistant\n",
    "Imagine you have hired an assistant to help review code\n",
    "* You show them a piece of code and an instruction(*observation*)\n",
    "* They think about it and and form their opinion of the code (*thought*)\n",
    "* They reply with a comment (*action*)\n",
    "\n",
    "So how does an AI Agent Observe, then Think and Act."
