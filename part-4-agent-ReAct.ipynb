    "# Agents That Think: Introducing the ReAct Pattern\n",
    "In our previous tutorials, we established the basic building blocks of an LLM agent. We implemented the **observe**,**think**,**act** loop, we added **tool use** and **memory**.  \n",
    "Our agent can now read code, suggest improvements and remember past interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, what happens when the agent makes a mistake, or its suggested action doesn't achieve the desired outcome? This is where **ReAct** comes in. In this tutorial, we'll introduce the **ReAct pattern** and show how to enable our agent to integrate reasoning with tool use, intepret the results of it's actions and adapt it's next steps accordingly, making it a more reliable, flexible and effective assistant.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The ReAct Pattern: Think, Act, Observe\n",
    "The **ReAct**(Reasoning and Acting) pattern is a powerful pattern that combines **Reasoning** steps with **Action** steps performed via tools.\n",
    "* **Thought(Reasoning)**: The LLM internally reasons about the current situation and determines the next **Action** to take.\n",
    "* **Action**: The agent executes the chosen action (e.g. calling a tool like `read_file(sample.py)`)\n",
    "* **Observation** The result of the action (tool output) is returned to the agent, serving as the observation for the next turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Reasoning is Essential for Agent Success\n",
    "* **Self-correction**: Reflection allows the agent to recognize when a tool call failed or when the output didn't align with the goal.\n",
    "* **Plan Adjustment**: The agent can assess the progress of the plan and modify its approach dynamically. For instance if it suggests a fix, the reasoning step can verify that the suggested fix actually addresses the original problem.\n",
    "* **Increased Robustness**: By incorporating a dedicated step to reason about its outputs, the agent becomes less prone to \"hallucination\" and its responses are more grounded in real world tool outputs."
